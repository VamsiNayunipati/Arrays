### Arrays
1. Write a program (CountryAndCodeList.java) that has two empty arrays.  
2. Both take input from user for the elements(use Scanner).  
3. Maximum number of elements is 4 for both the arrays. One will take name of country and the other one will take country code for phone calls to that country.
4. After creating the empty arrays, insert these data for country: Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Germany.
5. For the country code, load these data: 34, 351, 39, and 49.
6. Extract the values of all the elements for both the arrays in two separate print statements.
7. With a third print statement, print the elements of both arrays so that it’s displayed in a table format – aligning properly with a header “Country and Code List”.
